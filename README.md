### Type Pashto

This javascript module is used to help web developers apply the functionality of type pashto language without any need to change the system language.

To Use: 

	<input lang="ps-af" type="text"/>


and add a reference in your html file to the TypePashto.js

	<script type="text/javascript" src="TypePashto.js"></script>

For this module to work perfectly the input element needs to have an attribute of lang="ps-af".

This module will itself make the input box's text align right to lift so that it is shown properly in the input box.
